This MOD is in a very grey area when it comes to modder conduct by using and merging outdated mods without permission although the licences allow this.
I do however have only good intentions and make no claims to merged mods.
Any MOD or part not created specifically by NSI(Vernon Perdew) will be removed quickly and an update to this mod will be made, ONLY when the ORIGINAL AUTHOR updates said mod to the current version of KSP.

Please post any issues discovered or part requests to the issue tab here: https://github.com/NextStarIndustries/Next-Star-Industries/issues

Early releases of updates can be gotten from here: https://github.com/NextStarIndustries/Next-Star-Industries/tree/dev

Any pull requests must go to the dev branch, all others will be ignored.
