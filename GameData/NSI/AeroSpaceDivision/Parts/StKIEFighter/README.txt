The K.I.E fighter runs on xenon gas, and flies as you would expect a tie fighter should, great in space, okaaaayish in an atmosphere.  It can easily reach munar orbit on a single tank, however there are larger tanks for truly extended travel.
Tech tree integration. Not tested with any other mods.
Highly modular so change it up!


*** RasterPropMonitor & ModuleManager Support ***

This mod provides automatic support for RasterPropMonitor 0.25 (for ksp 1.1) and module manager 2.6.22 for (ksp 1.1)

This mod can operate without using these mods, however it will only show stock instruments inside the IVA.

To use these mods:

Intall them as usual in your KSP GameData directory and Spacetackle's K.I.E Fighter mod will automatically detect them, which will add additional props to the IVA.
