INSTRUCTIONS FOR USAGE

All of the craft use advanced reactors and other things that defy the laws of physics. 

Enable all Reactors (For endless fuel)

Action Group your engines, (Usually 1 for Hover, and 2 For main drives)


Warning, the Temperature models in KSP Suck, so overheating is possible on some craft, I have adjusted the settings under ALT F12 to elimintae this issue.

All ships have airlocks and some have upper deck airlocks. I have assigned minimal crew to the YT-1300 (2) but you can change that. None of them have Internals, Sorry, If you have any questions of anything, check the forum under the Skunk_Works thread.
