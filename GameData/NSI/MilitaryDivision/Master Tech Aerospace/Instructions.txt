If you want Raster Prop Moniter to work in your IVA's you must download it seperately

If you already have the latest Quiztech Aero pack version installed you do not need to insert the one from the MTA download into your gamedata.

Enjoy and thanks for downloading! Let me know if you have and suggestions, critiques, or compliments!
