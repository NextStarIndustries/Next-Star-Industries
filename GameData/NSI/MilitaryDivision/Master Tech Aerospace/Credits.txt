All credit for the IVA's for the cockpits goes to Squad and the creators of the Quiztech Mod. I used their IVA's with permission for my mod and they are required mod downloads for this mod to work.
All credit for the radar and weapons manager systems in the cockpits goes to the creators of BD Armory
Also a huge thank you to Nestor de Buen for his massive amounts of help in creating this mod and answering all of my dumb questions!
Credit for the base texture swatches goes to Rob Forrest
