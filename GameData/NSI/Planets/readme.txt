DEATH STAR version 0.3 for KSP 1.1.3

THIS MOD REQUIRES KOPERNICUS TO FUNCTION!

INSTALLATION:
0. Have Kopernicus ready to go in your KSP install.
1. Choose whether you want your Death Star to orbit Jool or Kerbin.
2. Select the corresponding folder.
3. Merge the GameData folder in that folder with the GameData folder in your KSP directory.
4. Launch KSP and lock S-wings in attack position!
===========================================================================

This mod is an addon for Kopernicus that adds a small moon orbiting Kerbin, meant to resemble the Death Star from Star Wars. It has a superlaser crater and a trench running down the equator. The superlaser, unfortunately, does not work and the ground textures are a bit off due to the nature of planets in KSP. The textures I made are pretty crude and WIP, but eventually I will improve on them. Feel free to make your own if you have image-editing expertise, and I will gladly credit you if you publish them. Enjoy, and may the Force be with you!

===========================================================================

New in 0.3:
-The crater is a bit less blocky, but my "fix" made the trench have sloped walls.
-Added an option to have the Death Star in orbit of Jool, to ease replication of the Battle of Yavin. X-Wings and TIE Fighters not included.
